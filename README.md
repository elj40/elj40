# Hi there, I'm Elai! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Elias Joubert, but you can call me Elai. I'm an aspiring machine learning enthusiast and game developer entering my first year of studies. I like turning ideas into code and exploring the intersections of technology and creativity.

Feel free to check out my repositories for more sandbox projects and experiments!
