# Hi there, I'm Elai! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Elias Joubert, but you can call me Elai. I'm an aspiring machine learning enthusiast and game developer entering my first year of studies. I like turning ideas into code and exploring the intersections of technology and creativity.

## Projects

Here are some projects I'm planning to work on:



1. **Patrol Sheet Scanner**
   -  A tool to scan in hand-written patrol sheets made by scouts to greatly speed up the admin process of ecological studies
  
2. **Waterpoint Disruption simulation** (Complete but requiring tweaking)
   - A visulization tool to show clients the effects of placing artificial waterpoints in normally drier areas

3. **Neural Network Experimentation**
   - Experiment with different sizes and layouts of neural networks to try find best case for a self-driving car


Feel free to check out my repositories for more sandbox projects and experiments!
